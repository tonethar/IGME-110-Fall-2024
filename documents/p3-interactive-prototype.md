## I. Interactive Prototype - Work Plan
For this deliverable, your group will create a detailed work plan that outlines the steps you will take to develop and pitch your digital prototype. This plan will serve as a roadmap for your project and must include project goals, roles, responsibilities, tasks, timelines.&nbsp;

Although each group member will guide the team in a specific role (as outlined below), everyone is expected to contribute to all parts of the project.

### I-A. Your work plan should include the following components:
#### 1. Project Goal and Infographic Analysis:

Begin by clearly defining your project goal based on the infographic your group selected. Explain why you chose that particular infographic, analyze it and explain how it serves as the foundation for your project. Identify the core experience that your prototype will address.

#### 2. Target Audience:

Identify the primary target audience for your project. Consider the infographic’s original message and who would benefit most from the solution or information presented in your prototype. Describe how the needs and preferences of this audience will shape the design and functionality of your prototype.

#### 3. Roles and Responsibilities:

While all group members will participate in every stage of the project, each member will take on a guiding role to help keep the group organized and focused in specific areas:
- **Project Manager**: Guides organization, scheduling, and task management.
- **Research Lead**: Directs research and analysis of the infographic and supporting data.
- **Design Lead**: Oversees visual design and user experience.
- **Prototype Developer**: Leads the creation of the interactive prototype.
- **Usability Tester**: Guides user testing and feedback integration.
- **Content Lead** (For groups of 6): Directs the development of any narrative, text, or messaging.

- Be sure to include the name of each group member and their guiding role. Describe how each role will support the project and contribute to both the prototype and presentation.

### I-B. Task Breakdown and Timeline:
Break the project into phases:
- **Research and Planning**: Finalizing your concept and understanding the infographic.
- **Design and Development**: Creating initial designs and building the prototype.
- **Testing and Feedback**: Creating the feedback form, testing your prototype and incorporating feedback from the in-class critique.
- **Final Submission and Presentation**: Refining the final prototype and preparing the presentation.

For each phase, create a list of tasks needed to complete the prototype, along with the person or people responsible for each task. Include a timeline that outlines when each task will be completed. Make sure to account for user testing, feedback sessions, and any changes you plan to make after receiving critique.

### I-C. Submission Instructions:
Submit a document (PDF or docx) outlining your group’s work plan. Be sure to include each of the above components. The work plan will guide your project from start to finish, so be as detailed as possible while remaining realistic about timelines and expectations.

## II. Interactive Prototype - Lo-Fi Version

In class, your group will present the first draft of your digital prototype. This draft should be interactive enough to allow others to test its core functionality and design elements. The purpose of this draft is to gather meaningful feedback from your classmates, which will help guide improvements before submitting the final version.

In addition to the prototype draft, your group will create a feedback survey designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project. This survey will help focus the feedback you receive and ensure that it addresses the most important aspects of your prototype.

### II-A. Assignment Requirements:
1. Prototype Draft:

The prototype draft should be functional enough to demonstrate the core idea of your project. While it doesn’t need to be fully polished, it should reflect:

The concept you are developing based on your selected infographic.

The core features that will help your audience interact with the project.

The initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel of the project.

This draft will be tested by your peers in class, so ensure it is accessible and ready to be interacted with.

2. Feedback Survey:

Your group will create a feedback survey to collect focused and actionable feedback from those who test your prototype. The survey should be designed to gather information on:

Usability: Is the prototype easy to navigate? Are there any confusing or unintuitive elements?

Design: How effective are the visual and interactive elements? Does the design align with the goals of the project?

Concept: Is the core idea clear and well-executed? Does the prototype address the problem or message from your selected infographic?

Your survey should include a mix of open-ended questions and scaled responses (e.g., Likert scale). Make sure the questions are clear, concise, and focus on areas where feedback will be most helpful. Create the survey using Google Forms, be prepared to share the link with your classmates during the feedback session.

Submit both the prototype and the form to myCourses before the dropbox closes.
