## III. In-class exercise Mood Board (we'll do this Thursday)
- Before you start creating a visual design--whether it's print, online, or interactive--it can be very helpful to start with a mood board. Mood boards can help you express ideas and the design goals of your project, even when you're having trouble coming up with the words to describe them.
