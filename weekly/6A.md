## I. *The Medium is the message*

- *"The medium is the message" is a phrase coined by the Canadian communication theorist Marshall McLuhan and the name of the first chapter in his [Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man](https://mcluhan.org/understanding-media/), published in 1964. McLuhan proposes that a communication medium itself, not the messages it carries, should be the primary focus of study.*
