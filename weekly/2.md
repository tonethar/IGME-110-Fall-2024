# Week 2

- Welcome back!

## I. Review of last week

- ***Study Guide #1: Course Kickoff/Getting Started***
  - almost all of you filled out this "getting to know you" survey
- ***Getting started 0: Intro to GitHub*** - was about publishing to GitHub (markdown)
  - Here are some **listicle.md** examples:
    - https://github.com/anthonyarchung/IGME-110-Repo/blob/main/my-listicle.md
    - https://github.com/zoombinipasta/IGME-110-Repo/blob/main/myListicle.md
    - https://github.com/ahf-rit/IGME-110-Repo/blob/main/my-listicle.md
- HTML/CSS/JS Basics
- ***Getting started 0.5: GitHub Pages*** - was about creating an **index.html** file and viewing it on github at `https://yourGitHubId.github.io/IGME-110-Repo/`
  - Here are some **index.html** examples:
    - https://elijahlostvegas.github.io/IGME-110-Repo/
    - https://misterfinigan.github.io/IGME-110-Repo/ (RickRolling!)
    - https://jessicay33.github.io/IGME-110-Repo/
    - https://mel8978.github.io/IGME-110-Repo/
    - https://mallory-rit.github.io/IGME-110-Repo/
    - https://tqgiabao2006.github.io/IGME-10-repo/
  - But a few people didn't complete this, OR just didn't get it working ...
    - ... it's important that you do!
    - so I'll re-open the dropbox for this assignment until 11:59PM tonight, **be sure to touch base with me about what you missed**, *before you leave today*

## II. This week's assignments

### II-A. *Getting Started 1: Professional Email Practices*
- This is in the myCourses gradebook - it's basically just "send the professor an email" ...
- ... but you don't need to send me an email right now!
- Instead, **I** am going to now use myCourses to **send you ALL an email** ...
- ... please check your RIT email client - if you receive this email give me a thumbs up ...
- and I'll give you all full credit in the grade book!

### II-B. *Getting Started 2: Using Our Slack Workspace*
- Here is our Slack 110 Workspace Link - https://rit-igme-110-2241.slack.com/
- ***Right now*** - Make sure that you can login to Slack, and then head to your section specific channel (`110-section04`, `110-section05` or `110-section06`), read the message I pinned at the top, and give it a thumbs up.
- Instructions are here: [Getting Started 2: Using the IGME-110 Slack Workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wt2ca7RM6IAuVanypWYKVB4M_W37be1hmwk_YltMHs0/edit?pli=1#heading=h.gjdgxs)
  - there is also a myCourses "Assignment" under the Assignments tab (aka "Dropbox")
  - note the "Action Items"

  - it also shows the link above - but you don't need to submit anything to the dropbox
