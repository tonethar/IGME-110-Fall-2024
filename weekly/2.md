## II. This week's assignments

### II-A. Getting Started 1: Professional Email Practices
- This is in the myCourses gradebook - it's basically just "send the professor an email" ...
- ... but you don't need to send me an email right now!
- Instead, **I** am going to now use myCourses to **send you ALL an email** ...
- ... please check your RIT email client - if you receive this email give me a thumbs up ...
- and I'll give you all full credit in the grade book!

### II-B.
