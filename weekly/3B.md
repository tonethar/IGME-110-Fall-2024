  - ***This is due next Wednesday 9/18 start of class (sections 04/05) or next Thursday 9/19 start of class (sections 06)**
  - *Before class, your group will have a solid first draft of the product proposal - that means more than just bullet lists or a handful of vague sentences!*
  - *You'll need to make your draft visible to anyone at RIT who has the link, and then share the link to this thread*
  - *In class you'll be reading through the other groups' propsal docs and filling out a critique form that we'll provide*

## III. Product Proposal Instructions - some tips

### 1. Executive Summary
- Consider being very specific about the audience:
  - ex. instead of "VR Gloves", consider *"VR Gloves for Gamers"* or *"VR Gloves for First Responders"*
  - ex. Instead of "Taser Bed", consider *"Taser Bed for busy people"* or *"Taser bed for unhoused students"*

### 2. Market Research and Needs Analysis
- Don't forget about "Mintel Market Research" which is available through the RIT library

### 3. Product Description
- Visuals/mock-ups would be nice

### 4. Possible Problems & Counter Arguments
- Recall that in teams of 4, everyone does this

### 5. Conclusion & Recommendations
