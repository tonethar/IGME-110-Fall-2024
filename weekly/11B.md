# Week 11B

## I. "Prototype Petting Zoo" 
- This lo-fi version *"should be functional enough to demonstrate the core idea of your project"*
- Have your working digital prototype "ready to test" and running on at least 2 lab PCs 
  - In your section-specific Slack channel, post a link to the survey where testers can give feedback about their experiences (look for your team's thread and "reply in thread" there with the link). Be sure to make the survey permissions "visible to all of RIT"
  - Take notes about how testers are interacting with the prototype, difficulties they had, features they requested, and so on
  - See dropbox for final submission due date/time
- Links:
  - [Project 3 requirements are here (for all 3 deliverables)](../documents/p3-interactive-prototype.md)
