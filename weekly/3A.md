## II. This Week's Assignments  

### II-A. Study Guide 2: Finding & Evaluating Information
- Instructions, links and "starter" document you will be submitting are here: [Study Guide 2: Finding & Evaluating Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKDYoEhBuw5CmN20XqTu21ejhsadrX4jJziFZos82LQ/copy)
- There is also a myCourses "Assignment" for this under the Assignments tab (aka "Dropbox")
  - it shows the due date - which is important! - *Friday Sep 13, 11:59 PM*
  - it tells you how to submit the assignment, which in this instance is a PDF or Word doc uploaded to the dropbox
- Let's head to the starter document and look over the readings:
  - i) Properly citing sources
    - and the good news is ..?
  - ii) Fact Checking: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #2 - deciding what's credible
    - Go beyond focusing on the professional presentation of the site, and instead focus on these 3 questions:
    - 1) *Who is behind this information, and what is their motivation for sharing it?*
    - 2) *What is the claim itself? What is the evidence for their claims? What is the source of this evidence?*
    - 3) *What do other sources say about the organization and its claims? Check multiple sources.*
    - ***Have discussions with real data and real cost-benefit analyses. Better information leads to better decisions. Try to be skeptical, not cynical. Make a habit of fact checking information that we find interesting or sharable or that makes us emotional.We have to train our internal falsehood alarms to respond not just to potential misinformation we disaagree with.***
  - iii) RIT Library InforGuide for Interactive Games and Media: https://infoguides.rit.edu/game-design
    - Do some searches/look under the menus:
      - "Design of Everyday Things"
      - O'Reilly Media & LinkedIn Learning
      - mintel market research
      - GDC proceedings
      - Internet Arcade
