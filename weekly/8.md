  - VC is the conveyance of information and ideas through visual elements such as images graphics and design. Can be used to infuse freshness and excitement into familiar concepts and can con tribute to deeper understanding of subject matter.
  - Two components:
      - Communication Design - craft a message that educates, motivates and engages
      - Graphic Design - use design principles to communicate that message so that it is clear and eye catching
  - Effective Visual Communication should be equally appealing and informative
  - Some examples: Infographics, Process Diagrams, Flow Charts, Roadmaps, Charts and Graphs, Visual Reports, Presentations, Mind Maps
    - e.g. Instructions on a website. The example graphic was much more approachable than a dense wall of text on a web page.
