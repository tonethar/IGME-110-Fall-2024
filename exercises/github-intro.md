## \*\* Part A - Setup your GitHub Account \*\*

1. Please set up your GitHub account (you may already have one, or you might have already set it up for a GCCIS programming class).
You will need to give GitHub your school email address at some point. 
Tip: You will likely have this account for a long time, so choosing a SFW ("Safe for Work") user name is advisable.

2. Apply for the student developer pack (this will give you FREE private repos).

3. Here's the link for signing up: https://github.com/education

4. BTW - For some GitHub functions you will need to have MFA set up - https://www.rit.edu/its/multi-factor-authentication-mfa

    - for GitHub MFA, I use the "Duo" app and have a separate account I named "GitHub"
