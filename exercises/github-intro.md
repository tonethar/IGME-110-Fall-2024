# Github Intro & Make a "Listicle"!

- [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is frequently used in your IGM college courses to host software projects and related code, as well as other files and documents. It uses [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) which provides distributed version control.
- GitHub can also be used to publish and host [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents (markdown is a lightweight markup language)
- GitHub also provides one free website per account (this would be a website written in HTML, **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage)
- GitHub is ***free*** for education users (students/faculty/staff)

## \*\* Part A - Setup your GitHub Account \*\* (Only do this if you do not already have one!)

1. Please set up your GitHub account (you may already have one, or you might have already set it up for a GCCIS programming class).
You will need to give GitHub your school email address at some point. 
Tip: You will likely have this account for a long time, so choosing a SFW ("Safe for Work") user name is advisable.

2. Apply for the student developer pack (this will give you FREE private repos).

3. Here's the link for signing up: https://github.com/education

4. BTW - For some GitHub functions you will need to have MFA set up - https://www.rit.edu/its/multi-factor-authentication-mfa

    - for GitHub MFA, I use the "Duo" app and have a separate account I named "GitHub"

---

### 5 - Try editing README.md first

- Reference:
  - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
  - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
  - https://www.markdowntutorial.com/
- Things to try:
  - create level-1 and level-2 headers
  - create a horizontal rule
  - make unordered and ordered lists
  - create a hypertext link to RIT's home page
  - do that again, but make the text "RIT" clickable
  - display an image (give it an image URL from the web)
- Don't forget to click "Commit changes ..." when you are done!
- Take a look at this page's markdown:
  - this page was create with markdown!
  - click the "Raw" button to see it

---

## \*\* Part C - Create a Listicle! \*\*

- Listicles are simply lists of Hypertext links that might be useful/interesting to other people
- Here are 2 examples of lists that could be considered useful:
  - https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists
  - https://github.com/leereilly/games

### Exercise - create your own IGME-110 listicle in markdown and publish it to GitHub

- Name the file **my-listicle.md**
- Give the list whatever theme you want  (but be sure to keep it SFW!) - some ideas:
  - IGME-110 media resources
  - Generative AI Resources
  - Board Games list, Video game list, ...
  - Cool places
  - Some other list related to a hobby of yours
  - etc
- At a minimum, use level-1 and level-2 headers, a list of "clickable" links (with at least 5 items in it) and bold text
- Don't forget to click "Commit changes ..." when you are done!
- **Submission:** See [https://mycourses.rit.edu](https://mycourses.rit.edu/) "Assignments" tab to see where to upload your link
