# Github Intro & Make a "Listicle"!

- [Github](https://github.com/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is frequently used in your college courses to host software projects and related code, as well as other files and documents. It uses [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) which provides distributed version control.
- GitHub can also be used to publish and host [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents (markdown is a lightweight markup language)
- GitHub also provides one free website per account (this would be a website written in HTML, **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage)
- GitHub is ***free*** for education users (students/faculty/staff)

## \*\* Part A - Setup your GitHub Account \*\*

1. Please set up your GitHub account (you may already have one, or you might have already set it up for a GCCIS programming class).
You will need to give GitHub your school email address at some point. 
Tip: You will likely have this account for a long time, so choosing a SFW ("Safe for Work") user name is advisable.

2. Apply for the student developer pack (this will give you FREE private repos).

3. Here's the link for signing up: https://github.com/education

4. BTW - For some GitHub functions you will need to have MFA set up - https://www.rit.edu/its/multi-factor-authentication-mfa

    - for GitHub MFA, I use the "Duo" app and have a separate account I named "GitHub"

### 5 - Try editing README.md first

- Reference:
  - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
  - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
  - https://www.markdowntutorial.com/
- Things to try:
  - create level-1 and level-2 headers
  - create a horizontal rule
  - make unordered and ordered lists
  - create a hypertext link to RIT's home page
  - do that again, but make the text "RIT" clickable
  - display an image (give it an image URL from the web)
- Don't forget to click "Commit changes ..." when you are done!
- Take a look at this page's markdown:
  - this page was create with markdown!
  - click the "Raw" button to see it

---

## \*\* Part C - Create a Listicle! \*\*

- Listicles are simply lists of Hypertext links that might be useful/interesting to other people
- Here are 2 examples of lists that could be considered useful:
  - https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists
  - https://github.com/leereilly/games

### Exercise - create your own IGME-110 listicle in markdown and publish it to GitHub

- Name the file **my-listicle.md**
- Give the list whatever theme you want  (but be sure to keep it SFW!) - some ideas:
  - IGME-110 media resources
  - Generative AI Resources
  - Board Games list, Video game list, ...
  - Cool places
  - Some other list related to a hobby of yours
  - etc
- At a minimum, use level-1 and level-2 headers, a list of "clickable" links (with at least 5 items in it) and bold text
- Don't forget to click "Commit changes ..." when you are done!
- **Submission:** See [https://mycourses.rit.edu](https://mycourses.rit.edu/) "Assignments" tab to see where to upload your link
