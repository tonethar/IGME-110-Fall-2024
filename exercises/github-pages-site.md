# Creating a GitHub Pages Site

## I. Recap
- Last time ([GitHub Intro](github-intro.md)) we learned:
  - how to create a new GitHub repository named ***yourGithubId*/IGME-110-Repo**
  - how to create new documents in the respository
  - how to use basic markdown to format text content (headers, bold and italic text, and horizontal rules)
  - how to display display images
  - create hypertext links to web pages

### Demo
- Review of basic markdown covered last time
- How to create folders on a repo and upload files
  - go ahead and grab this ZIP of images -> [images.zip](../_files/images.zip)
  - and we will show you to upload them GitHub, and then link to them from **README.md**

## II. Markdown vs. HTML/CSS/JSS

- While markdown is a great way to simply and quickly format documents and to add simple interactivity (hypertext links) to them, web pages created with it are lacking many features that are taken for granted on the web today, including:
  - content rich web sites that use visually interesting fonts and animation - check out RIT's home page as an example - https://www.rit.edu/
  - web sites that gather information from users utilizing forms
  - web sites (like Google Docs) that are full blown apps that can replace desktop applications such as Word and Excel
  - web sites that can run games and interactive experiences - here is an IGME-330 project writen in JavaScript that is running on GitHub Pages: https://tonethar.github.io/projects/procedural-flowers/latest/index.html
 
###  HTML/CSS/JSS
- HyperText Markup Language
